# RustRayTracer
A basic ray tracing program written in the Rust programming language

I created this project to learn Rust. I followed the ray tracer tutorial called [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, but translated the C++ code into Rust.

I like Rust a lot more than C++ now.
