# RustRayTracer
A basic ray tracing program written in the Rust programming language

I created this project to learn Rust. I followed the ray tracer tutorial called ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley] (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), but translated the C++ code into Rust. TL;DR I like rust a lot more than C++ now.
